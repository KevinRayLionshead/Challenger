## Release 1.39 - November 26th - Sparse Virtual Texture Support | Stormland
The Forge has now support for Sparse Virtual Textures on Windows and Linux with DirectX 12 / Vulkan. Sparse texture (also known as "virtual texture", “tiled texture”, or “mega-texture”) is a technique to load huge size (such as 16k x 16k or more) textures in GPU memory.
It breaks an original texture down into small square or rectangular tiles to load only visible part of them.

The unit test 18_Virtual_Texture is using 7 sparse textures:
* Mercury: 8192 x 4096
* Venus: 8192 x 4096
* Earth: 8192 x 4096
* Moon: 16384 x 8192
* Mars: 8192 x 4096
* Jupiter: 4096 x 2048
* Saturn: 4096 x 4096

There is a unit test that shows a solar system where you can approach planets with Sparse Virtual Textures attached and the resolution of the texture will increase when you approach.

## Release 1.38 - November 14th - Cross-Platform Path Tracer
- The new 16_Raytracing unit test shows a simple cross-platform path tracer. On iOS this path tracer requires A11 or higher. It is meant to be used in tools in the future and doesn't run in real-time.
To support the new path tracer, the Metal raytracing backend has been overhauled to use a sort-and-dispatch based approach, enabling efficient support for multiple hit groups and miss shaders. The most significant limitation for raytracing on Metal is that only tail recursion is supported, which can be worked around using larger per-ray payloads and splitting up shaders into sub-shaders after each TraceRay call; see the Metal shaders used for 16_Raytracing for an example on how this can be done.

    Head over to [Custom Middleware](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/Custom-Middleware) to check out the source code.
 * macOS / iPad / iOS: ICB support for Metal renderer (draw; draw indexed; pipeline state switch with ICB; ICB optimization with BlitEncoder). The Visibility Buffer example now uses ICB features on MacOS
   * reduced memory consumption for argument buffers in Metal
   * fixes for Metal implementation of descriptor set
   * minor fixes and optimizations in Metal renderer
   * Due to bugs in the run-time for argument buffers we still can't run unit test 04, 06, and 10
 
 The Visibility Buffer example runs now faster on macOS
![macOS Visibility Buffer](Screenshots/ProfilerScreenshot_VisibilityBuffer.png)
 
## Release 1.36 - October 18th - New File System
 * New cross-platform FileSystem C API, supporting disk-based files, memory streams, and files in zip archives. The API can be viewed in [IFileSystem.h](Common_3/OS/Interfaces/IFileSystem.h), and all of the example code has been updated to use the new API.
   * The API is based around `Path`s, where each `Path` represents an absolute, canonical path string on a particular file system. You can query information about the files at `Path`s, open files as `FileStream`s, and copy files between different `Path`s.
   * The concept of `FileSystemRoot`s has been replaced by `ResourceDirectory`s. `ResourceDirectory`s are predefined directories where resources are expected to exist, and there are convenience functions to open files in resource directories. If your resources don’t exist within the default directory for a particular resource type, you can call `fsSetPathForResourceDirectory` to relocate the resource directory; see the unit tests for sample code on how to do this.
   * There's a new 12_FileSystem unit test that demonstrates how to read files from zip archives:

![File System Unit Test](Screenshots/12_FileSystem.png)
 
 * Vulkan: Adaptive Order Independent Transparency with Raster Order Views is now supported when VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_FRAGMENT_SHADER_INTERLOCK_FEATURES_EXT is supported.

# Unit Tests
There are the following unit tests in The Forge:

## 1. Transformation

This unit test just shows a simple solar system. It is our "3D game Hello World" setup for cross-platform rendering.

![Image of the Transformations Unit test](Screenshots/01_Transformations.PNG)

## 2. Compute

This unit test shows a Julia 4D fractal running in a compute shader. In the future this test will use several compute queues at once.

![Image of the Compute Shader Unit test](Screenshots/02_Compute.PNG)

## 3. Multi-Threaded Rendering

This unit test shows how to generate a large number of command buffers on all platforms supported by The Forge. This unit test is based on [a demo by Intel called Stardust](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-vulkan-graphics-api-to-render-a-cloud-of-animated-particles-in-stardust-application).

![Image of the Multi-Threaded command buffer generation example](Screenshots/03_MultiThreading.PNG)

## 4. ExecuteIndirect

This unit test shows the difference in speed between Instanced Rendering, using ExecuteIndirect with CPU update of the indirect argument buffers and using ExecuteIndirect with GPU update of the indirect argument buffers.
This unit test is based on [the Asteroids example by Intel](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/asteroids-and-directx-12-performance-and-power-savings).

## 6. Material Playground

This unit test shows a range of game related materials:

Hair:
Many years ago in 2012 / 2013, we helped AMD and Crystal Dynamics with the development of TressFX for Tomb Raider. We also wrote an article about the implementation in GPU Pro 5 and gave a few joint presentations on conferences like FMX. At the end of last year we revisited TressFX. We took the current code in the GitHub repository, changed it a bit and ported it to The Forge. It now runs on PC with DirectX 12 / Vulkan, macOS and iOS with Metal 2 and on the XBOX One. We also created a few new hair assets so that we can showcase it. Here is a screenshot of our programmer art:

![Hair on PC](Screenshots/MaterialPlayground/06_MaterialPlayground_Hair_closup.gif)

Metal:

## 7. Hardware Tessellation

This unit test showcases the rendering of grass with the help of hardware tessellation.

![Image of the Hardware Tessellation Unit test](Screenshots/07_Hardware_Tessellation.PNG)

## 8. glTF Model Viewer
A cross-platform glTF model viewer that optimizes the vertex and index layout for the underlying platform and picks the right texture format for the underlying platform. We integrated Arseny Kapoulkine @zeuxcg excellent [meshoptimizer](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer) and use the same PBR as used in the Material Playground unit test.
This modelviewer can also utilize Binomials [Basis Universal Texture Support](https://github.com/binomialLLC/basis_universal) as an option to load textures. Support was added to the Image class as a "new image format". So you can pick basis like you can pick DDS or KTX. For iOS / Android we go directly to ASTC because Basis doesn't support ASTC at the moment.

## 9. Light and Shadow Playground
This unit test shows various shadow and lighting techniques that can be chosen from a drop down menu. There will be more in the future.

 * Exponential Shadow Map - this is based on [Marco Salvi's](https://pixelstoomany.wordpress.com/category/shadows/exponential-shadow-maps/) @marcosalvi papers. This technique filters out the edge of the shadow map by approximating the shadow test using exponential function that involves three subjects: the depth value rendered by the light source, the actual depth value that is being tested against, and the constant value defined by the user to control the softness of the shadow
  * Adaptive Shadow Map with Parallax Correction Cache - this is based on the article "Parallax-Corrected Cached Shadow Maps" by Pavlo Turchyn in [GPU Zen 2](https://gpuzen.blogspot.com/2019/05/gpu-zen-2-parallax-corrected-cached.htm). It adaptively chooses which light source view to be used when rendering a shadow map based on a hiearchical grid structure. The grid structure is constantly updated depending on the user's point of view and it uses caching system that only renders uncovered part of the scene. The algorithm greatly reduce shadow aliasing that is normally found in traditional shadow map due to insufficient resolution. Pavlo Turchyn's paper from GPU Pro 2 added an additional improvement by implementing multi resolution filtering, a technique that approximates larger size PCF kernel using multiple mipmaps to achieve cheap soft shadow. He also describes how he integrated a Parallax Correction Cache to Adaptive Shadow Map, an algorithm that approximates moving sun's shadow on static scene without rendering tiles of shadow map every frame. The algorithm is generally used in an open world game to approximate the simulation of day & night’s shadow cycle more realistically without too much CPU/GPU cost.
  * Signed Distance Field Soft Shadow - this is based on [Daniel Wright's Siggraph 2015](http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2015/DynamicOcclusionWithSignedDistanceFields.pdf) @EpicShaders presentation. To achieve real time SDF shadow, we store the distance to the nearest surface for every unique Meshes to a 3D volume texture atlas. The Mesh SDF is generated offline using triangle ray tracing, and half precision float 3D volume texture atlas is accurate enough to represent 3D meshes with SDF. The current implementation only supports rigid meshes and uniform transformations (non-uniform scale is not supported). An approximate cone intersection can be achieved  by measuring the closest distance of a passed ray to an occluder which gives us a cheap soft shadow when using SDF.

To achieve  high-performance, the playground runs on our signature rendering architecture called Triangle Visibility Buffer. The step that generates the SDF data also uses this architecture.

![Signed Distance Field Soft Shadow Map](Screenshots/LightNShadowPlayground/SDF_XBOX_3.png)

Readme for Signed Distance Field Soft Shadow Maps:

To generate the SDF Mesh data you should select “Signed Distance Field” as the selected shadow type in the Light and Shadow Playground. There is a button called “Generate Missing SDF” and once its clicked, it shows a progress bar that represents the remaining SDF mesh objects utilized for SDF data generation. This process is multithreaded, so the user can still move around the scene while waiting for the SDF process to be finished. This is a long process and it could consume up to 8+ hours depending on your CPU specs. To check how many SDF objects there are presently in the scene, you can mark the checkbox "Visualize SDF Geometry On The Scene".

## 9a. Hybrid Ray-Traced Shadows
This unit test was build by Kostas Anagnostou @KostasAAA to show how to ray trace shadows without using a ray tracing API like DXR / RTX. It should run on all GPUs (not just NVIDIA RTX GPUs) and the expectation is that it should run comparable with a DXR / RTX based version even on a NVIDIA RTX GPU. That means the users of your game do not have to buy a NVIDIA RTX GPU to enjoy HRT shadows :-)
![Hybrid Ray Traced Shadows](Screenshots/09a_HRT_Shadows.png)


## 10. Pixel-Projected Reflections
This unit test shows reflections that are ray traced. It is an implementation of the papers [Optimized pixel-projected reflections for planar reflectors](http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2017/PixelProjectedReflectionsAC_v_1.92.pdf) and [IMPLEMENTATION OF OPTIMIZED PIXEL-PROJECTED REFLECTIONS FOR PLANAR REFLECTORS](https://github.com/byumjin/Jin-Engine-2.1/blob/master/%5BByumjin%20Kim%5D%20Master%20Thesis_Final.pdf)

![Image of the Pixel-Projected Reflections Unit test](Screenshots/10_Pixel-ProjectedReflections.png)

## 11. Multi-GPU (Driver support only on PC Windows)
This unit test shows a typical VR Multi-GPU configuration. One eye is rendered by one GPU and the other eye by the other one.

![Image of the Multi-GPU Unit test](Screenshots/11_MultiGPU.png)

## 12. File System Test
This unit test showcases a cross-platform FileSystem C API, supporting disk-based files, memory streams, and files in zip archives. The API can be viewed in [IFileSystem.h](/Common_3/OS/Interfaces/IFileSystem.h), and all of the example code has been updated to use the new API.
   * The API is based around `Path`s, where each `Path` represents an absolute, canonical path string on a particular file system. You can query information about the files at `Path`s, open files as `FileStream`s, and copy files between different `Path`s.
   * The concept of `FileSystemRoot`s has been replaced by `ResourceDirectory`s. `ResourceDirectory`s are predefined directories where resources are expected to exist, and there are convenience functions to open files in resource directories. If your resources don’t exist within the default directory for a particular resource type, you can call `fsSetPathForResourceDirectory` to relocate the resource directory; see the unit tests for sample code on how to do this.

## 16. Path Tracer - Ray Tracing Unit Test
The new 16_Raytracing unit test shows a simple cross-platform path tracer. On iOS this path tracer requires A11 or higher. It is meant to be used in tools in the future and doesn't run in real-time.
To support the new path tracer, the Metal raytracing backend has been overhauled to use a sort-and-dispatch based approach, enabling efficient support for multiple hit groups and miss shaders. The most significant limitation for raytracing on Metal is that only tail recursion is supported, which can be worked around using larger per-ray payloads and splitting up shaders into sub-shaders after each TraceRay call; see the Metal shaders used for 16_Raytracing for an example on how this can be done.

## 18. Sparse Virtual Textures
The Forge has now support for Sparse Virtual Textures on Windows and Linux with DirectX 12 / Vulkan. Sparse texture (also known as "virtual texture", “tiled texture”, or “mega-texture”) is a technique to load huge size (such as 16k x 16k or more) textures in GPU memory.
It breaks an original texture down into small square or rectangular tiles to load only visible part of them.

The unit test 18_Virtual_Texture is using 7 sparse textures:
* Mercury: 8192 x 4096
* Venus: 8192 x 4096
* Earth: 8192 x 4096
* Moon: 16384 x 8192
* Mars: 8192 x 4096
* Jupiter: 4096 x 2048
* Saturn: 4096 x 4096

There is a unit test that shows a solar system where you can approach planets with Sparse Virtual Textures attached and the resolution of the texture will increase when you approach.

# Examples
There is an example implementation of the Triangle Visibility Buffer as covered in various conference talks. [Here](https://diaryofagraphicsprogrammer.blogspot.com/2018/03/triangle-visibility-buffer.html) is a blog entry that details the implementation in The Forge.

![Image of the Visibility Buffer](Screenshots/Visibility_Buffer.png)


# Tools
Below are screenshots and descriptions of some of the tools we integrated.

## Microprofiler
We integrated the [Micro Profiler](https://github.com/zeux/microprofile) into our code base by replacing the proprietary UI with imGUI and simplified the usage. Now it is much more tightly and consistently integrated in our code base.

Here are screenshots of the Microprofiler running the Visibility Buffer on PC:

## Shader Translator
We provide a shader translator, that translates one shader language -a superset of HLSL called Forge Shader Language (FLS) - to the target shader language of all our target platforms. That includes the console and mobile platforms as well.
We expect this shader translator to be an easier to maintain solution for smaller game teams because it allows to add additional data to the shader source file with less effort. Such data could be for example a bucket classification or different shaders for different capability levels of the underlying platform, descriptor memory requirements or resource memory requirements in general, material info or just information to easier pre-compile pipelines.
The actual shader compilation will be done by the native compiler of the target platform.

 [How to use the Shader Translator](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge/wiki/How-to-Use-The-Shader-Translator)



# Releases / Maintenance
Confetti will prepare releases when all the platforms are stable and running and push them to this GitHub repository. Up until a release, development will happen on internal servers. This is to sync up the console, mobile, macOS and PC versions of the source code.

# Products
